# DripBox

## Dropbox (aka DripBox)

The purpose of this homework is to use Xcode to implement the flow between the screens of an application. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement the Dropbox app from the signed out state to the basic signed in state.

Time spent: `10`

### Features

#### Required

- [X] User can tap through the 3 welcome screens.
- [X] User can follow the create user flow.
  - [X] On the create user form, the user can tap the back button to go to the page where they can sign in or create an account.
  - [X] Before creating the account, user can choose to read the terms of service.
  - [X] After creating the account, user can view the placeholders for Files, Photos, and Favorites as well as the Settings screen.
  - [X] User can log out from the Settings screen.
- [X] User can follow the sign in flow.
  - [X] User can tap the area for "Having trouble signing in?".
  - [X] User can log out from the Settings screen.

#### Optional

- [ ] User can view a detail view for one of the files and favorite the file.
- [ ] User can actually type in the forms and tap to dismiss the keyboard.
- [ ] User can swipe through the welcome screens instead of just tapping them.
- [ ] User sees updated page indicator dots using page control.
- [ ] User can view actual Dropbox Terms of Service in a web view.
- [ ] User is presented with native action sheet to view and agree with terms of service.
- [ ] User sees updated password strength as they type in password field.

#### The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I'm unsure of how to manually segue
2. Would like to learn how to programatically add push and pop on the stack
3. App was crashing (spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out why app was crashing in my settings View Controller - turns out my variables were not assigned correctly... (terminology may be wrong here, but can describe it in class). I had to look over the logs and search for the error string to find a clue.

### Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I'd like to spend more time next time to do all the optional features. Got started on this a little late - but can understand how doing the lecture a second time (I dedicated time to do the lecture again) helped a ton. Lab work was super helpful as well, referred to those files a lot for this exercise.

* Any libraries or borrowed content.
